# RejectCharacterDeletions
Is a work-around to ROBLOX's most RejectCharacterDeletions update
RejectCharacteDeletions prevents player's from deleting objects in the
character, thus allowing them to "control" them.

This isn't technically a bypass, but a work-around.
( PS: YOU CANNOT MOVE LIMBS. ONLY ACCESSORIES. )

Eitherway, enjoy the work-around

# RCD Bypass Example
This is a Remote Control Dummy Script I created:

It is composed of accessories, as you can only move accessories, not limbs.
