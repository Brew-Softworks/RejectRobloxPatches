# RejectCharacterDeletions
Is a work-around to ROBLOX's most RejectCharacterDeletions update
RejectCharacteDeletions prevents player's from deleting objects in the
character, thus allowing them to "control" them.

This isn't technically a bypass, but a **work-around**.
- **( PS: YOU CANNOT MOVE LIMBS. ONLY ACCESSORIES. )**

Eitherway, enjoy the work-around

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/RCDBypass.lua"))()
```
- **YOU MUST WRITE YOUR OWN CODE AFTER LOADING THE STRING.**

# Features
- Allows movement of accessories
- Does not "fail" ( means it the parts wont fall )
  ^ this was all i can think of

# RCD Bypass Example
This is a Remote Control Dummy Script I created using UGC Catalog Accessories:

It is composed of accessories, as you can only move accessories, not limbs.
