# RejectCharacterDeletions
Is a work-around to ROBLOX's most RejectCharacterDeletions update
RejectCharacteDeletions prevents player's from deleting objects in the
character, thus allowing them to "control" them.

This isn't technically a bypass, but a work-around.

Eitherway, enjoy the work-around
