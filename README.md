# RejectCharacterDeletions
Is a work-around to ROBLOX's most RejectCharacterDeletions update
RejectCharacteDeletions prevents player's from deleting objects in the
character, thus allowing them to "control" them.

This isn't technically a bypass, but a **work-around**.
- **( PS: YOU CANNOT MOVE LIMBS. ONLY ACCESSORIES. )**

Eitherway, enjoy the [work-around](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/RCDBypass.lua)
originally by @Ficelloo

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/RCDBypass.lua"))()
```
- **YOU MUST WRITE YOUR OWN CODE AFTER LOADING THE STRING.**

# Netless

Additionally, if you are in a game that does not have `workspace.RejectCharacterDeletions` set to `true`, you can run [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/AcessoryNetless.lua).
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dex4tw/RejectCharacterDeletions/main/AcessoryNetless.lua"))()
```
This allows you to move your hats around while preventing them from falling. ( You may edit the Velocity in the source-code )
